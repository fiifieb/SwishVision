# SwishVision: Basketball Shot Predictor

## Overview
**SwishVision** is a computer vision-based basketball shot predictor built using the **CVZone** library. The system tracks a basketball in motion and, based on its initial travel path, predicts the future trajectory of the shot. The goal is to determine if the ball will land in the basket using real-time analysis.

## Features
- **Real-time Ball Tracking**: Detects and tracks the basketball's motion using **CVZone**.
- **Trajectory Prediction**: Predicts the shot’s path using initial travel points like velocity, angle, and position.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Displays trajectory prediction while the ball is in motion.
- **Customizable Accuracy**: Adjusts prediction sensitivity and accuracy based on the shot's data points.

## Technologies
- **Python**: Core programming language for implementing logic.
- **CVZone**: Used for simplifying the process of computer vision and tracking tasks.
- **OpenCV**: Base for image processing and frame capture.
- **NumPy**: For data manipulation and mathematical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: To visualize the predicted path of the ball.

## How it Works
1. **Ball Detection**: CVZone and OpenCV are used to detect and track the basketball within the video feed.
2. **Initial Data Capture**: The ball’s position, speed, and trajectory angle are calculated from the initial travel points.
3. **Trajectory Prediction**: Based on the initial data, a prediction is made whether the ball will land in the basket or not.
4. **Prediction Output**: The predicted path of the ball is displayed in real-time on the screen.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- CVZone
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/swishvision.git
    cd swishvision
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the program:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage
1. **Start the System**: Launch the script to start tracking the basketball in a video feed.
2. **Real-time Prediction**: SwishVision will display the predicted shot trajectory in real-time.
3. **Visualization**: The shot path will be visually displayed, indicating whether it’s likely to land in the basket.

## Future Improvements
- **Advanced Ball Physics**: Incorporate factors such as ball spin and wind resistance to improve accuracy.
- **Enhanced Visualization**: Add a heatmap of probable shot paths.
- **Shot Classification**: Categorize different types of shots (e.g., layups, 3-pointers) for specific prediction models.
